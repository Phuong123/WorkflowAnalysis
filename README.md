**Data Analytics and Its Application**
======================================

A broad array of companies ranging from the largest global banks to regional transport firms are using data analytics to solve diverse sets of problems These diverse applications have one commonality: using data and statistics as the basis for decision making.

**Data Analytics**
------------------

Analytics is defined as the process of developing the actionable insights through the application of statistical model and analysis from the data. Applying data analytics for decision making is a systematic process.

**Data Collection**
-------------------

The first step in the process is data collection. Data relevant to the applicant is collected. The quality, quantity, validity, and nature of data directly impact the analytical outcome.

**Data Preparation**
--------------------

Usually raw data is not in a format that can be directly used to perform data analysis. In very simple terms, most platforms require data to be in a matrix form with the variables being in different columns and rows representing various observations.

**Data Analysis**
-----------------

Once data is converted into a structured format, the next stage is to perform data analysis. At this stage underlying trends in the data are identified. This step can include fitting a linear or nonlinear regression model, performing principal component analysis or cluster analysis, identifying if data is normally distributed or not.

**Model Building**
------------------

Put the data to work and build a model that will help with the given application or help solve a business problem. A vast number of statistical models are available that can be used, and new models are being developed every day.

Results obtained from the models are validated to ensure accuracy and model robustness. This can be done two ways; the first is by splitting the original data set into training and validation data sets. In this approach, part of the data is used for model building and the remaining part is used for validation. The other approach is to validate data against real-time data once the model is deployed.

Once the model is developed it is deployed in a real-time setting for a given application.

**Types of Analytics**
----------------------

### Descriptive Analytics

### Predictive Analytics

### Prescriptive Analytics

**Understanding Data and Its Types**
------------------------------------

### Quantitative data

**Big Data Analytics**
----------------------

### Big Data Analytics Challenges

### Big Data Analytics Tools

#### IBM SPSS Statistics and SPSS Modeler: Data Mining and Text Analytics Software

#### Python

#### Rapid Miner

**Examples**
------------

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

**Ploting and ggplot2**
-----------------------

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
