## Creating Graphs with ggplot 

This is a summary for essential graph techniques in R. In this work, we will consider how to create graphs using ggplot. There are some basic steps those we should focus on plotting a graph.

* Setting up variables for plotting
* Adding color, symplol type, size and shape as layers
* Controlling plotting backgrounds and margins
* Creating line graphs, histograms, bar charts, and boxplots
* Using attractive color schemes

The aim of this report is to provide a basic principle behind the creation of graphic graphs in ggplot.
## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

# Start to code with R


```r
summary(cars)
```

```
##      speed           dist       
##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

![plot of chunk pressure](figure/pressure-1.png)

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
