## Creating Graphs with ggplot 

This is a summary for essential graph techniques in R. In this work, we will consider how to create graphs using ggplot. There are some basic steps those we should focus on plotting a graph.

* Setting up variables for plotting
* Adding color, symplol type, size and shape as layers
* Controlling plotting backgrounds and margins
* Creating line graphs, histograms, bar charts, and boxplots
* Using attractive color schemes

The aim of this report is to provide a basic principle behind the creation of graphic graphs in ggplot.
## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
